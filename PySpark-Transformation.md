# Mappers and Reducers
Data summarization design patterns are techniques used to summarize large datasets into smaller, more meaningful representations, and the latest information on this topic includes various methods and models.we will explore the most important Spark transformations (mappers and reducers) in the context of data summarization design patterns, and examine how to select specific transformations for targeted problems.

### Data summarization design patterns 
-  Include in-mapper combining, top-10, min-max, and binning, which are used to reduce the size of large datasets while preserving important information.
-  Hierarchical indexing is a technique used to create summaries at each hierarchical level, allowing for efficient searching and retrieval of data. This method is useful in text search and information retrieval applications.
-  Abstractive summarization generates new text based on the original text to summarize it effectively.
-  Data can be summarized using various models, including complete, summarized, minimal, and identifier models.
